# No Automatic Test Creation

**FORBIDDEN**: NEVER create, suggest, or generate test files unless the user explicitly requests them.

## Examples of Explicit Requests

✅ User asks: "Write tests for the Calculator class"
✅ User asks: "Add unit tests"
✅ User asks: "Create a test file for this component"

## Prohibited Behavior

❌ Creating test files proactively after implementing features
❌ Suggesting "we should add tests" without being asked
❌ Adding test files to TODO lists unless user requested testing
❌ Including tests in implementation plans unless user mentioned testing

## When Tests ARE Requested

When the user explicitly asks for tests:
- Write comprehensive, well-structured tests
- Follow project testing conventions
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
