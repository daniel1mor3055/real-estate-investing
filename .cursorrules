# Python Development Rules

## Virtual Environment Requirements
- ALWAYS use python3 instead of python
- ALWAYS use pip3 instead of pip
- ALWAYS work within a Python virtual environment (venv)
- If no virtual environment exists, create one first using: python3 -m venv venv
- ALWAYS activate the virtual environment before any Python operations: source venv/bin/activate (on macOS/Linux) or venv\Scripts\activate (on Windows)

## Package Management
- Install packages using: pip3 install <package_name>
- Generate requirements using: pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
- Install from requirements using: pip3 install -r requirements.txt
- Never install packages globally - only within the activated virtual environment

## Python Execution
- Run Python scripts using: python3 script_name.py
- Use python3 for all Python commands and scripts
- Ensure virtual environment is activated before running any Python code

## Project Setup
- When setting up a new Python project:
  1. Create virtual environment: python3 -m venv venv
  2. Activate environment: source venv/bin/activate
  3. Install required packages: pip3 install -r requirements.txt (if exists)
  4. Run the project: python3 main.py

## Terminal Commands
- Always check if virtual environment is active (look for (venv) in prompt)
- If not active, remind to activate with: source venv/bin/activate
- Use python3 and pip3 in all command suggestions and examples

## Error Handling
- If import errors occur, first check if virtual environment is activated
- If packages are missing, install them using pip3 within the active venv
- Never suggest using sudo with pip installations
